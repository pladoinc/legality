# Contribution Guide

We welcome all contributions, big and small. We just have a few
guidelines we would like to follow when you make contributions:

 * Please ensure that each individual pull request you submit is
 a single fix or change. This is helpful when we want to organize
 contributions and pinpoint when a change happened.

 * Please verify that your changes do not have any spelling or grammatical
 errors. We all make mistakes, we would just like to minimize the frequency
 of such.

 * Please ensure that you use the proper command words that is appropriate
 for legal documents and that your changes are clear enough to be interpreted
 by anyone without extra context.
