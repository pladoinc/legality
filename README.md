# [Legality](http://docs.plado.ca/) by [PLADO](https://plado.ca/)

Makes üìÉ  easier to understand without üîç.

## What's this?

Legality is a intuitive interface that allows third-parties to understand and
interact with the documentation that PLADO uses. It's a way for us to attempt to
ensure that we are very translucent about the fine print on our contracts and to
avoid any confusion and misunderstanding about how we do things at PLADO.

## Why is it so open?

We wanted to develop Legality from the ground up as being open source so that we
could benefit from all that comes with the world of open source. We are looking for
any and all contributions towards bettering our documentation as well as the code
of Legality. For more details, please see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
